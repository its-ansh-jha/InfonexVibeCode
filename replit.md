# Vibe Code - AI-Powered App Building Platform

## Overview
Vibe Code is an AI-powered app building platform that allows users to create applications through natural language conversation with AI. The platform stores files in AWS S3, runs code in E2B sandboxes with real-time preview, and provides streaming AI responses for an interactive development experience.
